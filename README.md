jhullRvn-githubtrial:  __All meaning is derived from context.__

The idea that “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure” is based on the chasm that exists between two opposing contexts. I ~~may~~ see the world differently than you, ~~but~~ and from my perspective I am right. Likewise, from where you stand the way you see the world is correct to you. Meaning depends on the perspective we take; what a given set of events or information __means__ *objectively* then must at least take into account both the "I" context behind the purveyor of the information and the "You" context of the receiver of the information. As it turns out, in order to make a complete argument, in order to best fully exemplify the meaning behind a story, at least four perspectives should be dramatized for the receiving audience.

This may be too dull or scholarly.
**Jhull then jumps into perspective from the Dramatica approach with no connection to general meaning of perspective.**
